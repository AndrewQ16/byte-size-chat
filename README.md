# byte-size-chat
A small chat app built with Node.JS, Express, Socket.io and MongoDB.

### Another messenger app?
Yup except in this case it was created to be easy-to-read so that anyone who may see this can see organized code that they can easily download and make their own version. *Or if they'd like, could send a pull request.* 

### What can it do?
1. It can do private room based messaging for users who just enter a name and room in the window prompt (this will be a bit more formal as I continue).
2. Coming Soon :pray:

### What will it eventually it do?
Great question! I'll be updating this read.me as new features get added. Currently the plan is the following:
1. Allow users to register via a registration page.
2. Authentication and authorization of users.
3. Tabs of rooms that users can go to and from.

### This sounds like Discord but with less features?
Right, this messenger app models it from a feature perspective, not design since I could not do that :sweat_smile:

### Now what?
At the time of this commit. I'm currently in the middle of refactoring the code to organize it.
